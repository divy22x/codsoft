        <h2>ABSTRACT:</h2>
        <p>pre-election survey conducted in the Tirunelveli, Radhapuram, and Palayankottai Assembly constituencies. The study explores the significance of public opinion survey techniques in understanding the dynamics of rapidly developing constituencies. It delves into the unique socio-political landscapes of these regions, outlining challenges and considerations for conducting a comprehensive pre-election survey. From intricate voter sentiment analysis to political preferences, the research navigates through the complexities inherent in these areas. Machine learning algorithms offer a promising approach to assist in the analysis of pre election survey data and improve diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate a machine learning model for the analysis of pre election survey data. We will use a dataset collect from the peoples `diagnosed with pre election survey to train and test the model. The performance of the model will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately classify peoples with pre election survey and identify relevant features associated with the condition. The results of this study have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pre election survey diagnosis and management.

    <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
<p>
    The study introduces the exploration of pre-election surveys within the context of the upcoming elections in Tirunelveli, Radhapuram, and Palayankottai Assembly constituencies. It aims to comprehend the influence of these surveys on voter choices and their broader impact on the political landscape. we aim to analyze pre election survey using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately diagnose pre election survey based on different features of our survey such as <br>1.  Location, <br>2. Area, <br>3. Assembly,<br> 4. Gender,<br>5. Whom would you like to see as the PM in 2024?,<br> 6. How is the current Tamil Nadu government ruling?,<br>7. Would you benefit from the central government schemes?<br> This model will help to make more accurate predict and provide to predict with pre election survey. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we hope to provide a more effective solution to the challenges of pre election survey. The intention is to actively involve residents in shaping the democratic process narrative, emphasizing their role. The study seeks to uncover insights into the role and impact of pre-election surveys on the electorate and the democratic framework in the specified regions.

<h2>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed research design begins with data gathering, in which we leveraged data can be collect GOOGLE FORM FILLING SURVEY for the pre-election survey problem. Then, in the data exploration phase, we used various sorts of tables and figures to try to comprehend the data and relationships between characteristics, such as bar plots, pie charts, and so on.

        <h2>Stratified Sampling Method:</h2>
        
       <p> Stratified random sampling is a method of selecting a sample in which researchers first divide a population into smaller subgroups, or strata, based on shared characteristics of the members and then randomly select among each stratum to form the final sample.</p>
